# arm-lecture
ARM programs to illustrate tutorials
--------------------------------------------
This repository fork from the embedded course teach by Jim Huaug.
I modified something as follow to satisfy the request from class : 

1.Implement the Finonacci sequence by using ARM assembly in two ways,recursive and ierterative.

2.Try to optimize the code 

3.Try to evaluate the efficiency of the Fibonacci sequence and compare recursive and non-recursive performance.

4.Modify the makefile and add a script file to generate Fibonacci sequence from 5 to 40 automaticlly.
